# BrainSegmentation
CS188 Project by Rishub Kumar and Patrick Deshpande
Brain lesions are abnormal tissue in/on brain tissue. We have refined a program (using the pix2pix tensorflow library) that will highlight brain lesions given a png image of a brain. This program will help automate the tedious task of manually highlighting brain lesions, and strives to perform just as well as a human operator.
